Use the provided Makefile to build the code.  
There are two executables, a simple executable and a stress executable
for you to test with.
Just typing "make" will make both the simple and stress executables.  
"make simple" will build just the simple
version and "make stress" will build just the stress version.
Use ./simple_client to run the simple client and ./simple_server
to run the simple server.  The stress versions can be run in the same way
with simple replaced with stress.

top directory:
send_this_text.txt - simple test data

File breakdown:
client directory:
app_simple_client.c - simple client application
app_stress_client.c - stress client application
srt_client.c - srt client side source file
srt_client.h - srt client side header file

server directory:
app_simple_server.c - simple server application
app_stress_server.c - stress server application
srt_server.c - srt server source file
srt_server.h - srt server header file

common directory:
seg.c - snp function implementation, act on segments
seg.h - snp function header
constants.h - define some useful constants

Considerations: 

	Full disclosure: This program runs most of the time, but sometimes it will get endless seglosses. I never found out why this happens, so when it does, I just recompile and run again. 

	Because the passing in of integers was giving me undefined behavior, I took care of that on the app side of things, and made sure that only characters could be passed into the receive and send functions so that things such as file size could be transported properly.
