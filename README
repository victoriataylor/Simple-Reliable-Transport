## Program Description: 
	Implements a signaling protocol (SYN, SYNACK, FIN, FINACK), as well a “sliding window” protocol for efficient data transfer between the client and server (unidirectional reliable byte stream). The data transfer protocol resolves issues such as lost or corrupted packets by using Go-Back-N.

## Contents
In client directory:
	app_simple_client.c - simple client application source file
	app_stress_client.c - stress test client application source file
 	srt_client.h - srt client header file	
	srt_client.c - srt client source file
	send_this_text.txt - text file to be sent by stress test application
In server directory:
	app_simple_server.c - simple server application source file
	app_stress_server.c - stress test client application source file
	srt_server.h - srt server header file
	srt_server.c - srt server source file
In common directory:
	seg.h - segment header file
	seg.c - segment source file
	constants.h - constants used by SRT 


## Building
	make will compile both simple and stress applications
	make clean to clean executables and remove received_text.txt

## Running
To run simple application:
goto server directory and run ./app_simple_server
goto client directory and run ./app_simple_client
To run stress application:
